# achiu's dotfiles #

This a collection of dotfiles I use for my day to day use. Mainly its a
collection of dotfiles as well as configuration and setup I've borrowed
from other's dotfiles to make my own custom setup.

## Setup ##

To get it up and running, you can simply:

````bash
$ rake install
````
